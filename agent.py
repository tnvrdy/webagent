System prompt, agent loop, per-step logging

approach/flow of an episode:
1. take starting url and goal/instruction
2. call get_observation() to get initial observation
3. build user message with observation, goal, and history
4. call llm to get action
5. parse and validate action
6. execute action
7. log action in jsonl
8. advance action history
9. repeat 2-8 (one step) until stop or max_steps

using single-turn system prompt/user message for now, dont think we need context of past outputs yet
as long as we give action history in user message, model can reason about it

Rules:
1. Output EXACTLY ONE action per reply, on a single line. Nothing else — no explanation, no preamble.
2. Use only the actions listed above. Any other output will be treated as a parse error.
3. When the GOAL is achieved, output: stop
4. If the page does not help and you cannot make progress, output: stop
